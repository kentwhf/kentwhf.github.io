abstract: We evaluate two text classification methodologies, Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) and Neural Attentive Bag-of-Entities(NABoE), by retraining the models and obtaining competitive state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis on the hyperparameters. We also extend the methods to a standard benchmark AG News to compare their strengths and weaknesses; NABoE takes more time to train while SGC requires large amount of memory for graph building.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We evaluated two text classification methodologies, Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) and Neural Attentive Bag-of-Entities(NABoE), by performing hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, extending to a new dataset, and experimenting with the model architechtures. The final report was written in NeurIPS format.
