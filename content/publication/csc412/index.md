abstract: Music composition with complex models has received more attention in recent years, fuelled by the rising interests in algorithmic art creations. This project aims to generate polyphonic melodies with a linguistic approach, comparing performance between variants of hidden Markov models (HMM) and an Encoder-Decoder network that uses long-short term memory (LSTM) cells, which are commonlyn used in language generation tasks. The main objective of this project is to construct pleasant melodies that sound indistinguishable from human-composed ones. The project evaluates the modelsâ€™ performance by both quantitative and qualitative measures and discusses possible areas for explorations.
